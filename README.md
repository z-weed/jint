Simple sentiment analysis with python (because it should be easy)

Still a WIP. Ultimate goal is providing a very simple, easy to understand, interface to NLP. Python is not my "first language" so I may step over some conventions.

```
# Usage: python main.py "I saw a movie the other day. It was all right"

[{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}]
```
